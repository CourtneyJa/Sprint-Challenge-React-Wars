1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React JS is a javascript library that was designed to help build larger apps, or apps that can/will become large in their future, while maintaining clean code that is broken down into components. This component structure allows you to create items that you can use multiple times, without having to fully rewrite your code (keeps you DRY). Additionally, React JS uses virtual DOM, allowing you to make and view your changes without adjusting the actual DOM right away.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

    Thinking in react means you will need to determine what is going in your site, how you want the site setup, and how you can break the design and content down into smaller components. 

3. Describe state.

    State is an object (the data) that represents a smaller portion of the app that can change. Each component built in an app can maintain its own state. 

4. Describe props.

    Props are data that is read only and passed from one component of the app to another component within that same app. 

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    Side effects are anything that affects something outside of the scope of the function that is being executed. An example of this is calling data from API.
